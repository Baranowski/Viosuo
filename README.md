**Note: This repo has not been cleaned up and prepared for general consumption
at all. This is basically just a dump of the project files. If there is any
interest I will be happy to clean it up, put up some instructions on how to
customize, print and build this keyboard. I'm not sure anyone else might be
insterested and so I didn't want to put in that extra work needlessly.**


What's this?
============

3D-printable parts of a pretty weird but fully functional keyboard. My design goals:
* It has to be fully usable while walking
* Even though it's strapped to the arms, it should not hinder basic
  manual tasks that a programmer might need to perform during his work, most
  importantly: preparing and drinking coffee.
* It should be impossible or extremely rare to 'get lost' on the keyboard, i.e.,
  to become uncertain where specific keys are located in relation to the user's
  fingers
* It has to offer all the keys, including modifiers, for normal writing,
  programming and using software such as vim, tmux, etc.
* The typing speed should not suffer _too much_. It might be impossible to reach
  the same speed as on a standard QWERTY keyboards though - some sacrifice is
  acceptable
* (Non-critical) It should look nerdy


Name and pronunciation
======================

Viosuo is pronounced like the [Polish word for
oar](https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=pl&text=oar&op=translate). I chose
this name because an early prototype looked a lot like an oar and was as
uncomfortable as it sounds.


What's in this repo
===================

* The `stl/` subdirectory contains STL files of the most recent design. All of
  them can be easily printed on Ender 3.
* The `viosuo.FCStd` is a FreeCAD file with the entire design. It's done really,
  really badly mostly due to my inexperience, but also because I was working
around the [Topological Naming problem](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Topological_naming_problem).
* `macros/hole_puncher.py` is a simple FreeCAD macro that for a selectedy Body finds all surfaces that look like they might be inteded for a key and cuts out a 14x14mm square through the middle, intended for an MX switch
* `macros/fc_plumbing.py` is my quickly-abandoned attempt at writing a framework
that would make python scripting in FreeCAD much easier. I still think
somethink like this would be an amazing tool and should be reasonably easy to
create but I'm too lazy to do it myself. I'm including this here since
`hole_puncher` depends on it.
* `zmk/` is my fork of the [ZMK framework](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk)
with a keymap and all the necessary boilerplate for Viosuo added.

=======

Um... I don't know. I will pick one if there is any interest. It will be
something open and permissive.
